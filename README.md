README for ARAF browser for Android (v2.0) and GPAC version 0.6.2-DEV

Augmented Reality Application Format (ARAF) is a collection of a subset of the ISO/IEC 14496-11 (MPEG-4 part 11) Scene Description and Application Engine standard, combined with other relevant MPEG standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 23005 - MPEG-V), designed to enable the consumption of 2D/3D multimedia content.  
The ARAF browser for Android is built on top of Osmo4 which is a multimedia player developed within GPAC framework (see below).

GPAC is a multimedia framework oriented towards rich media and distributed under the LGPL license (see COPYING).
GPAC supports many multimedia formats, from simple audiovisual containers (avi, mov, mpg) to complex 
presentation formats (MPEG-4 Systems, SVG Tiny 1.2, VRML/X3D). GPAC supports scripting of presentation for MPEG4/VRML/X3D through
mozilla SpiderMonkey javascript engine.
GPAC currently supports local playback, http progressive download, Adaptive HTTP Streaming (MPEG-DASH, HLS), RTP/RTSP streaming over UDP (unicast or multicast) or TCP and TS demuxing (from file, IP or DVB4Linux).
GPAC also features MP4Box, a multimedia swiss-army knife for the prompt.
